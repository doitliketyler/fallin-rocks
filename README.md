# Fallin' Rocks
### A coding challenge for Phylos

This was a fun challenge. It was my first time working with a 2d physics engine so I didn't have enough time to really dive in and do everything I would have liked to within the 4 hours. Below is a breakdown of what I did every hour followed by what I would of liked to do and a demo site.

- **1st hour** - Looked up "2d Physics Engine" and found matter.js. Researched matter.js aawhile and played around.
- **2nd hour** - Browsed the API and created a world with a static "cross" and set amount of "rocks" falling onload.
- **3rd hour** - Added jQuery to save time and created buttons that add rocks and crosses to the world onclick.
- **4th hour** - Created a randomize button that placed a cross and 0-10 rocks at random locations.
- **Last 15m** - Made stuff look pretty with CSS because I didn't have enough time to do anything else.

### If I had more time I would have:
- Made the "cross" not overlap
- Made the "rocks" circles that stack
- Added sprites that resemble rocks and the letter T
